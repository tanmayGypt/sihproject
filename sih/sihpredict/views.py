content = ["With India and Canada in the middle of a diplomatic face-off over the killing of Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, the Ministry of External Affairs on Wednesday issued an advisory urging Indian nationals and students in Canada to “exercise utmost caution”. “In view of growing anti-India activities and politically-condoned hate crimes and criminal violence in Canada, all Indian nationals there and those contemplating travel are urged to exercise utmost caution,” the advisory reads. “Recently, threats have particularly targeted Indian diplomats and sections of the Indian community who oppose the anti-India agenda. Indian nationals are therefore advised to avoid travelling to regions and potential venues in Canada that have seen such incidents.” This comes after Canada, alleging potential links between the Indian government and the killing of the pro-Khalistan leader, expelled a top Indian diplomat. In a tit-for-tat move, India responded by ousting a senior Canadian diplomat in Delhi.",
                "While Bihar Chief Minister and Janata Dal (United) supremo Nitish Kumar has said he was ready for an early Lok Sabha election, he seems to be increasingly out of sync with the Opposition alliance INDIA or his senior partner in Bihar's ruling Mahagathbandhan (grand alliance), the RJD, on various issues.Among other issues, Nitish is said to be uncomfortable with the RJDs alleged bid to sharpen “backward versus forward” politics by not reining in its Education Minister Chandra Shekhar, who continues to criticise Ramcharitmanas.",
                "It was on July 1, 2020, when the Centre for the first time took a strong decision against the Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) chief Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was killed in June this year, and eight others, designating them as “terrorists” for actively running a secessionist campaign against India from abroad and motivating Sikh youth from Punjab to join militant ranks.In February this year, the Centre had notified KTF as a “terrorist organisation” under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). Giving reasons for declaring KTF as a terror organisation, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said, “It is a militant outfit and it aims to revive terrorism in Punjab and challenges the territorial integrity, unity, national security and sovereignty of India and promotes various acts of terrorism, including targeted killings in Punjab”.",
                "In the Valley, Jammu and Kashmir police keep a profile of every local militant  his age, educational and family background, ideological inclination and military expertise. While profiling underground militants, police categorise them as A, A+, A++,or B. There are several factors taken into account while deciding this  how lethal the militant is, how many attacks or killings he has carried out, his military understanding, his position in the terror outfit, or the potential to emerge as a central figure.For over a year, Uzair Khan was one among the less than 50 local militants on the police radar, categorised in their records as B  relatively less lethal and unlikely to emerge as a central figure.But a day after three top security officers  Col Manpreet Singh and Major Aashish Dhanchok of the Army's 19 Rashtriya Rifles and DSP Himayun Muzamil of J&K Police  were killed in a gunfight inside the dense forests of Gadole in south Kashmir's Kokernag, the spotlight turned to Uzair who, police believe, was behind the killings.",
                "The video of the incident went viral on social media on Friday.“After culmination of the prayers about a dozen persons started anti-national and provocative sloganeering, for a while this was joined by a couple of others as well, while most of the gathering remained aloof,Balwal said that the mosque management committee tried to stop the sloganeering which led to an altercation between those who raised the slogans and mosque volunteers.This created a situation of ruckus inside the mosque leading to clashes between them. Later the hooligans were dispersed outside the mosque by volunteers (of Mosque committee)",

This is as per the original Preamble. Amendments were made later, he asserted.Terming the matter as serious, Mr. Chowdhury said the words have been 'cleverly removed' and expressed doubts over the intentions of the BJP government.The Preamble of the Constitution in the copy that we carried to the new building does not include the words secular and socialist. They have been cleverly removed...this is a serious matter and we will raise this issue",
